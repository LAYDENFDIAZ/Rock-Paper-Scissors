// RPS

// Rock, Paper, Scissors. The familiar game of Rock, Paper,
// Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players
// display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors,
// scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.

// Create a prompt asking user if they want to play RPS
// create an arrey which stores all computer thow options (rock, paper, or scissors)
// create a computer which generates a ranadom number
// select option at index Computer Choice in arrey previously created
// create input which asks for users choice of throw (rock, paper, or scissors)
// compare the two options to a set of perameters and specifications
